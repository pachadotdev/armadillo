# Motivations

The development of cpp11armadillo emerges from the desire to follow a simplified
approach towards R and C++ integration by building on top of 
[cpp11](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cpp11), a ground up rewrite of C++
bindings to R with different design trade-offs and features. cpp11armadillo
aims at providing an additional layer to put the end-user focus on the
computation instead of configuration [@cpp11].

[Armadillo](https://arma.sourceforge.net/) is a linear algebra library for the
C++ language, aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. It is
justified in the fact that C++, in its current form, is very valuable to address
bottlenecks that we find with interpreted languages such as R and Python but it
does not provide data structures nor functions for linear algebra
[@Sanderson2016].

[RcppArmadillo](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppArmadillo) was first
published to CRAN in 2010, and it allows to use Armadillo via
[Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp), a widely extended R package
to call C++ functions from R [@Eddelbuettel2014].

# Design choices

The design choices in cpp11armadillo are:

- Providing a simpler implementation that makes the library easier to
  understand, maintain, and extend, benefiting both current users and future
  contributors.
- Offering a completely header-only approach, eliminating Application Binary
  Interface compatibility issues and simplifying library integration and
  distribution.
- Facilitating vendoring, which allows for the inclusion of the library
  directly in projects, thus simplifying dependency management and distribution.

These ideas reflect a comprehensive effort to provide an efficient interface for
integrating C++ and R that aligns with the Tidy philosophy [@Wickham2019],
addressing both the technical and community-driven aspects that influence
software evolution.

These choices have advantages and disadvantages. A disadvantage is that
cpp11armadillo will not convert data types automatically, the user must be
explicit about data types, especially when passing data from R to C++ and then
exporting the final computation back to R. An advantage is that cpp11armadillo
codes, including its internal templates, can be adapted to work with Python
via [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
[@pybind11].

cpp11armadillo uses @Hansen2022 notation, meaning that matrices are column-major
and vectors are expressed as column vectors (i.e., $N\times1$ matrices).

# Examples

Convention: input R matrices are denoted by `x`, `y`, `z`, and output or
intermediate C++ matrices are denoted by `X`, `Y`, `Z`. The example functions can
be called from R scripts and should have proper headers as in the following
code:

```cpp
#include <armadillo.hpp>
#include <cpp11.hpp>
#include <cpp11armadillo.hpp>

using namespace arma;
using namespace cpp11;

[[cpp11::register]] // allows using the function in R
doubles_matrix<> solve_mat(doubles_matrix<> x) {
  Mat<double> Y = as_Mat(x); // convert from R to C++
  Mat<double> Yinv = inv(Y); // Y^(-1)
  return as_doubles_matrix(Yinv); // convert from C++ to R
}
```

This example includes the Armadillo, cpp11 and cpp11armadillo libraries, and
allows interfacing C++ with R (i.e., the `#include <cpp11.hpp>`). It also loads
the corresponding namespaces (i.e., the `using namespace cpp11`) in order to
simplify the notation (i.e., using `Mat` instead of `arma::Mat`).

The `as_Mat()` function is provided by cpp11armadillo to pass a `matrix` object
from R to C++ and that Armadillo can read.

The `as_doubles_matrix()` function is also provided by cpp11armadillo to pass a
`Mat<double>` or `Mat<int>` object from C++ to R.

## Ordinary Least Squares

Given a design matrix $X$ and and outcome vector $y$, one function to obtain the
OLS estimator $\hat{\beta} = (X^tX)^{-1}(X^tY)$ as a matrix (i.e., column
vector) is:

```cpp
doubles_matrix<> ols_mat(const doubles_matrix<>& y, const doubles_matrix<>& x) {
  Mat<double> Y = as_Mat(y);
  Mat<double> X = as_Mat(x);

  Mat<double> XtX = X.t() * X; // X'X
  Mat<double> XtX_inv = inv(XtX); // (X'X)^(-1)
  Mat<double> beta = XtX_inv * X.t() * Y; // (X'X)^(-1)(X'Y)

  return as_doubles_matrix(beta);
}
```

The `ols_mat()` function receives inputs from R, does the computation on C++
side. The use of `const` and `&` are specific to the C++ language and allow to
pass data from R to C++ while avoiding copying the data, therefore saving time
and memory.

Another option is to express the same computation as a vector:

```cpp
doubles ols_dbl(const doubles_matrix<>& y, const doubles_matrix<>& x) {
  Mat<double> Y = as_Mat(y);
  Mat<double> X = as_Mat(x);

  Mat<double> XtX = X.t() * X;
  Mat<double> XtX_inv = inv(XtX);
  Mat<double> beta = XtX_inv * X.t() * Y;

  return as_doubles(beta);
}
```

## Eigenvalues

Given a matrix $X$, an eigenvalue of $X$ is any number $t$ such that $Xv = tv$,
where $v$ is a non-zero vector.

Two functions to obtain the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are:

```cpp
doubles_matrix<> eigen_sym_mat(const doubles_matrix<>& x) {
  Mat<double> X = as_Mat(x);
  Mat<double> y = eig_sym(X);
  return as_doubles_matrix(y);
}

doubles eigen_sym_dbl(const doubles_matrix<>& x) {
  Mat<double> X = as_Mat(x);
  Mat<double> y = eig_sym(X);
  return as_doubles(y);
}
```

When the input matrix is not symmetric, the eigenvalues are complex numbers.
cpp11armadillo provides a wrapper to return the real and imaginary parts of the
eigenvalues as a list:

```cpp
list eigen_gen_mat(const doubles_matrix<>& x) {
  Mat<double> X = as_Mat(x);
  Mat<complex<double>> y = eig_gen(X);
  list out = as_complex_matrix(y);
  return out;
}
```

The idea of cpp11armadillo is to integrate with cpp11 to provide flexibility,
and the previous result can be obtained without using the `as_complex_matrix()`
wrapper:

```cpp
list eigen_gen_mat(const doubles_matrix<>& x) {
  Mat<double> X = as_Mat(x);

  Mat<complex<double>> y = eig_gen(X);

  Mat<double> y_real = real(y);
  Mat<double> y_imag = imag(y);

  writable::list out;
  out.push_back({"real"_nm = as_doubles_matrix(y_real)});
  out.push_back({"imag"_nm = as_doubles_matrix(y_imag)});

  return out;
}
```

As with OLS, in this case it is possible to return a list of vectors instead of
a matrices:

```cpp
[[cpp11::register]]
list eigen_gen_dbl(const doubles_matrix<>& x) {
  Mat<double> X = as_Mat(x);
  Col<complex<double>> y = eig_gen(X);
  list out = as_complex_doubles(y);
  return out;
}
```

## Cholesky decomposition

One function to decompose a matrix $X$ into an upper (lower) triangular matrix
$R$ such that $X = R^tR$ ($X = RR^t$) is:

```cpp
doubles_matrix<> chol_mat(const doubles_matrix<>& x, std::string type) {
  Mat<double> X = as_Mat(x);

  Mat<double> res;

  if (type == "upper") {
    res = chol(X);
  } else if (type == "lower") {
    res = chol(X, "lower");
  } else {
    stop("Invalid type");
  }

  return as_doubles_matrix(res);
}
```

This function uses the second argument to avoid creating a new function for the
lower triangular decomposition.

## QR decomposition

One function to decompose a matrix $X$ into a product $X=QR$ where $Q$ is an
orthogonal matrix and $R$ is an upper triangular matrix is:

```cpp
list qr_mat(const doubles_matrix<>& x, bool econ) {
  Mat<double> X = as_Mat(x);

  Mat<double> Q;
  Mat<double> R;

  bool computable;

  if (!econ) {
    computable = qr(Q, R, X);
  } else {
    computable = qr_econ(Q, R, X);
  }

  if (!computable) {
    stop("QR decomposition failed");
  } else {
    writable::list out;
    out.push_back({"Q"_nm = as_doubles_matrix(Q)});
    out.push_back({"R"_nm = as_doubles_matrix(R)});
    return out;
  }
}
```

In this case, the function returns a list of matrices after using the second
argument to use two different Armadillo implementations of the QR decomposition.

## Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

Suppose there are two risky stocks, Pepsi and Coca-Cola, with returns for the
last three days given by a matrix $R$ in a market with a risk-free bond with
a return $f=2\%$ and a risky market portfolio with returns for the last three
days given by a vector $m$. The CAPM equation is given by
$R_i = f + \beta_i(E(m) - f)$, where
$\beta_i = \frac{\text{cov}(R_i, m)}{\text{var}(m)}$ [@Bodie2010].

The simulated returns are given by:

```r
set.seed(200100)
f <- 0.02
m <- matrix(rnorm(3, 0, 0.1), nrow = 3, ncol = 1)
r <- matrix(rnorm(6, 0, 0.1), nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
```

One function to obtain the CAPM betas for the two stocks is:

```cpp
doubles_matrix<> capm(const doubles_matrix<>& r, const doubles_matrix<>& m,
                      double f) {
  Mat<double> R = as_Mat(r);
  Mat<double> M = as_Mat(m);
  Mat<double> F = ones<Mat<double>>(R.n_cols, 1) * f;

  // Market average return and CAPM betas
  Mat<double> M_avg = ones<Mat<double>>(R.n_cols, 1) * as_scalar(mean(M, 0));
  Mat<double> beta = cov(R, M) / as_scalar(var(M));

  // Expected returns (% = pairwise multiplication)
  Mat<double> out = F + beta % (M_avg - F);

  return as_doubles_matrix(out);
}
```

## Leontief inverse

The Leontief Input-Output model posits that the equilibrium production in an
economy (i.e., country) with $N$ industries (i.e., sectors) is given by
$(I-A)^{-1}$, where $I$ is the identity matrix and $A$ contains the input
requirement for each industry $1\leq i \leq N$ from any other $1 \leq j \leq
N-1$ industry. $A$ is determined by a transaction matrix $X$ that reflects the
final transactions between industries and an aggregate demand vector $d$
[@Leontief1986].

We can use the data from the leontief package as data inputs for the example.

```r
library(leontief)
X <- transaction_matrix
d <- wage_demand_matrix[, "final_total_demand"]
```

One function to obtain the Leontief inverse is:

```cpp
doubles_matrix<> leontief_inverse(const doubles_matrix<>& x, 
                                  const doubles_matrix<>& d) {
  Mat<double> X = as_Mat(x);
  Mat<double> D = as_Mat(d);

  // Check dimensions
  bool X_square = (X.n_rows == X.n_cols);
  bool compatible_dimensions = (X.n_rows == D.n_rows);

  if (X_square == false) {
    stop("x must be square.");
  }
  if (compatible_dimensions == false) {
    stop("d must have the same number of elements as the number of rows in x.");
  }

  // Input requirement matrix
  Mat<double> Y = zeros(D.n_rows, D.n_rows);
  Y.each_col() += D;
  Mat<double> A = X / Y.t();

  Mat<double> I = eye(X.n_rows, X.n_cols); // Identity matrix

  Mat<double> out = inv(I - A); // Leontief inverse

  return as_doubles_matrix(out);
}
```

# Benchmarks

A proper benchmark is to compute eigenvalues for large matrices. Both
cpp11armadillo and RcppArmadillo use Armadillo as a backend, and the marginal
observed differences are because of how cpp11 and Rcpp pass data from R to C++
and viceversa. The computation times are identical.

|Input     | Median time cpp11armadillo | Median time RcppArmadillo |

The cpp11armadillo computation was obtained with the `eigen_sym_mat()` function
already shown.

The RcppArmadillo computation was obtained with the following function:

```cpp
#include <RcppArmadillo.h>
// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppArmadillo)]]

using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
arma::mat eigen_sym_mat(const arma::mat& x) {
  arma::mat y = eig_sym(x);
  return y;
}
```

In order to get the RcppArmadillo function to work, we had to dedicate time
to search online about the error `function 'enterRNGScope' not provided by
package 'Rcpp'`, which required to load additional headers in our code on R
side.

# Conclusion

RcppArmadillo has been and will continue to be widely successful. cpp11armadillo
is a alternative templated implementation with different design trade-offs and
features. Both packages can co-exist and continue to enrich the R community.

The goal of cpp11armadillo is to provide a novel approach to use the [Armadillo
C++ library](https://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html) by using the header-only
cpp11 R package and to simplify things for the end-user.

The idea is to pass matrices/vectors from R to C++, write pure C++/Armadillo
code for the computation, and then export the result back to R with the proper
data structures.

This follows from the same goals as cpp11:

* Enforcing copy-on-write semantics.
* Improving the safety of using the R API from C++ code.
* Using UTF-8 strings everywhere.
* Applying newer C++11 features.
* Having a more straightforward, simpler implementation.
* Faster compilation time with lower memory requirements.
* Growing vectors more efficiently.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cpp11armadillo like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("pachadotdev/cpp11armadillo")
```

## Minimal example

I have provided a package template for RStudio that also works with VS Code.

The idea of this package is to be naive and simple (like me).

From RStudio/VSCode create a new project and run:

```r
cpp11armadillo::pkg_template()
```

Then follow the instructions from the README.

Here is a commented example from the package template:

```cpp
#include <armadillo.hpp>
#include <cpp11.hpp>
#include <cpp11armadillo.hpp>

using namespace arma;
using namespace cpp11;
using namespace std;

[[cpp11::register]] doubles_matrix<> ols_mat(const doubles_matrix<>& y,
                                             const doubles_matrix<>& x) {
  Mat<double> Y = as_Mat(y);
  Mat<double> X = as_Mat(x);

  Mat<double> XtX = X.t() * X;
  Mat<double> XtX_inv = inv(XtX);
  Mat<double> beta = XtX_inv * X.t() * Y;

  return as_doubles_matrix(beta);
}
```

This code:

1. Includes the Armadillo, cpp11 and cpp11armadillo libraries and allows
   interfacing C++ with R (i.e., the `#include <XYZ.hpp>` lines).
2. Loads the corresponding namespaces (i.e., the `using namespace XYZ` lines)
   in order to simplify the notation (i.e., using `Mat` instead of `arma::Mat`).
3. Declares a function `ols_mat()` that takes inputs from R, does the
   computation on C++ side, and it can be called from R scripts. The use of
   `const` and `&` are specific to the C++ language and allow to pass data from
   R to C++ while avoiding copying the data, therefore saving time and memory.
4. `as_Mat()` is a C++ template (i.e., a "diplomat" function) that puts R and
   C++ data types in conversation and facilitates communications between those
   two. The templates for doubles/integers matrices are provided by
   `cpp11armadillo`.
5. `XtX = X.t() * X` calculates the product of the transpose of `X` and `X`.
6. `inv(XtX)` calculates the inverse of `XtX`.
7. `XtX_inv * X.t() * Y` calculates the OLS estimator.
8. `as_doubles_matrix()` is another template that takes `beta`, expressed as a
   C++ data structure, and converts it to a data structure that `cpp11` and R
   understand.

Certainly, the goal is to use linear algebra. This is a very simple example
and you are better-off using the `lm()` function from R for this particular
case.

For other tasks, you are better-off with C++-side computation because C++ can
address:

1. Loops that cannot be easily vectorised because subsequent iterations depend
   on previous ones.
2. Recursive functions, or problems which involve calling functions thousands/
   millions of times.
3. The overhead of calling a function in C++ is much lower than in R (and
   Python).
4. Problems that require advanced data structures and algorithms that R does not
   provide.
5. Through the Standard Template Library (STL), C++ has efficient
   implementations of many important data structures, from ordered maps to
   double-ended queues.

## More than minimal example

The `cpp11armadillotest` constains more examples that I use to test
`cpp11armadillo`, it is an R package that contains different scripts using
matrices and lists, and the idea is to be more expressive on the C++ parts
(i.e., using complex numbers) and then passing the data back to R using
creative ways (i.e., lists).

Here is an example from those scripts, which creates a list of matrices and a 
list of vectors:

```cpp
list eigen_gen_mat(const doubles_matrix<>& x) {
  Mat<double> X = as_Mat(x);

  Mat<complex<double>> y = eig_gen(X);

  Mat<double> y_real = real(y);
  Mat<double> y_imag = imag(y);

  writable::list out;
  out.push_back({"real"_nm = as_doubles_matrix(y_real)});
  out.push_back({"imag"_nm = as_doubles_matrix(y_imag)});

  return out;
}

list eigen_gen_dbl(const doubles_matrix<>& x) {
  Mat<double> X = as_Mat(x);

  Mat<complex<double>> y = eig_gen(X);

  Mat<double> y_real = real(y);
  Mat<double> y_imag = imag(y);

  writable::list out;
  out.push_back({"real"_nm = as_doubles(y_real)});
  out.push_back({"imag"_nm = as_doubles(y_imag)});

  return out;
}
```

## Next steps

Provide support for sparse matrices. At the moment, `cpp11armadillo` only works
with dense matrices.

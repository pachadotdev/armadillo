The goal of cpp11armadillo is to provide a novel approach to use the [Armadillo
C++ library](https://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html) by using the header-only
cpp11 R package and to simplify things for the end-user.

The idea is to pass matrices/vectors from R to C++, write pure C++/Armadillo
code for the computation, and then export the result back to R with the proper
data structures.

This follows from the same goals as cpp11:

* Enforcing copy-on-write semantics.
* Improving the safety of using the R API from C++ code.
* Using UTF-8 strings everywhere.
* Applying newer C++11 features.
* Having a more straightforward, simpler implementation.
* Faster compilation time with lower memory requirements.
* Growing vectors more efficiently.

If this software is useful to you, please consider donating on
[Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/pacha). All donations will
be used to continue improving `cpp11armadillo`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cpp11armadillo like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("pachadotdev/cpp11armadillo")
```

## Examples

I have provided a package template for RStudio that also works with VS Code.

The idea of this package is to be naive and simple (like me).

From RStudio/VSCode create a new project and run:

```r
cpp11armadillo::pkg_template()
```

Then follow the instructions from the README.

The vignettes constain detailed examples that I use to test `cpp11armadillo`,
these include Ordinary Least Squares, Leontief inverse, eigenvalues, and the
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).

## Next steps

Provide support for sparse matrices. At the moment, `cpp11armadillo` only works
with dense matrices.

date: "2024-08-30"
abstract: >
  This article introduces cpp11armadillo, a new R package that integrates the
  powerful Armadillo C++ library for linear algebra into the R programming
  environment. Targeted primarily at social scientists and other
  non-programmers, this article explains the computational benefits of moving
  code to C++ in terms of speed and syntax. We provide a comprehensive overview
  of Armadillo's capabilities, highlighting its user-friendly syntax akin to
  MATLAB and its efficiency for computationally intensive tasks. The cpp11armadillo
  package simplifies a part of the process of using C++ within R by offering
  additional ease of integration for those who require high-performance linear
  algebra operations in their R workflows. This work aims to bridge the gap
  between computational efficiency and accessibility, making advanced linear
  algebra operations more approachable for R users without extensive programming
  backgrounds.

# Introduction

`R` is widely used by non-programmers [@wickham2019], and this article aims to
introduce computational concepts in a non-technical yet formal manner for social
scientists. Our goal is to explain when and why moving code to C++ is
beneficial in terms of speed or syntax and how to do it using
[`cpp11armadillo`](https://pacha.dev/cpp11armadillo), our novel Armadillo and `R`
integration for linear algebra.

[Armadillo](https://arma.sourceforge.net/) is a C++ library designed for
linear algebra, emphasizing a balance between performance and ease of use.
C++ is highly efficient for computationally intensive tasks but lacks built-in
data structures and functions for linear algebra operations. Armadillo fills
this gap by providing an intuitive syntax similar to MATLAB [@sanderson2016].

[`rcpparmadillo`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppArmadillo),
introduced in 2010, integrates Armadillo with `R` through the Rcpp package,
enabling the use of C++ for performance-critical parts of `R` code
[@eddelbuettel2014]. `rcpparmadillo` is a widely successful project, and at the
time of writing this article, there are 755 packages on CRAN that
depend on it [@lee2024].

`cpp11armadillo` is an independent project that aims to simplify the integration of
`R` and C++ by using `cpp11`, an `R` package that eases using C++ functions
from `R`, and it is aligned with the tidyverse philosophy of simplicity and
user-centric design [@wickham2019; @cpp11]. Is it useful in cases where
vectorization (e.g., applying an operation to a vector or matrix as a whole
rather than looping over each element) is not possible or challenging, and it
can help to solve some bottlenecks as it simplifies the task of rewriting `R`
code that involves linear algebra as C++ code. Furthermore, it can be orders of
magnitude faster, computing operations in parallel, which is especially useful
for large objects. When vectorization is possible, using `R`'s built-in
functions is more efficient than writing loops in `R`, and the time of writing
the same in C++ justifies to continue to use vectorized operations in `R`.
'cpp11armadillo' is useful in cases where vectorization (e.g., applying an
operation to a vector or matrix as a whole rather than looping over each
element) is not possible or challenging, and it can help to solve some
bottlenecks as it simplifies the task of rewriting R code that involves linear
algebra as C++ code.

For cases where vectorization is applicable, @burns2011 provides a good
introduction. `cpp11armadillo` is relevant in a project where the same operation
is repeated many times and, at the same time, the computation time saved by
using C++ is greater than the time spent writing and fixing C++ code.
We followed four design principles when developing `cpp11armadillo`:

1. **Column oriented**: The code and documentation uses column vectors,
    following @hansen2022.
2. **Package oriented**: It is designed to be used in an `R` package, which is
    the recommended way to organize code in medium and large scale projects.
3. **Header only**: No separate actions are required; it only requires to
    include `cpp11armadillo` as a dependency.
4. **Vendoring capable**: It provides a dedicated function to copy the entire
    codebase into `R` packages, providing the option to make it a one-time
    dependency. This feature allows to run code in restricted environments
    (e.g., where installing packages from CRAN or GitHub is blocked by a
    firewall or available for administrators only).
# Interpreted and compiled languages

`R` is an interpreted language, meaning that the code is executed line by line
when you run a part or the totality of a script. One advantage of interpreted
languages is that they are easier to debug because the code can be run by parts
to isolate errors. Another advantage is that, assuming that all dependencies
are solved, the code can be run in any computer without additional
configurations. Other interpreted languages are Python, MATLAB, and
Wolfram.

C++ is a compiled language, meaning that to run the code, it must be
converted to an executable file containing instructions that the processor
can understand. This allows the compiler to optimize the code for the specific
hardware it is running on, making it faster than interpreted languages. The
main disadvantage of compiled languages is that they are harder to debug
because it is not possible to run the code by parts as when running `R` code
blocks on-the-fly. C++ code requires a compiler (e.g. gcc or clang) to
produce an executable file, which is a software separate from the editor (e.g.
RStudio or VS Code) that translates the code to machine code, and it is not
possible to use an executable produced on Windows with UNIX and vice versa.
Other compiled languages are C, FORTRAN, and Java.

`R` internals consist in functions written in C and FORTRAN that the end
user has ready-made to run scripts. These functions, while available in `R`
source code, are usually not of interest for the end user as these already have
a proven stability, even in corner cases, and those are written with memory and
speed efficiency at the expense of syntax and flexibility.

C inherent steep learning curve motivated C++ creation, and C++ is a
superset of C with additional features that make it easier to use and that
provides flexibility. C++ is a high-level language that can be used for a
wide range of purposes, including parts of operating systems (e.g., Windows),
internet browsers (e.g., Firefox) and streaming platforms (e.g., YouTube),
and it is particularly useful for computationally intensive tasks. Transitioning
from `R` to C++ involves adapting to several differences in conventions and
flexibility regarding data types and operations.

# Linear algebra libraries

Linear algebra libraries are essential for scientific computing, and they
provide functions for matrix operations, such as matrix multiplication,
inversion, and decomposition. These libraries are written in C or C++ and
are optimized for speed without compromising stability. Some of these libraries
are the Linear Algebra Package (LAPACK) and the Basic Linear Algebra
Subprograms (BLAS). As C and C++, these libraries have a long history and
time-tested correctness, and the first LAPACK release was in 1992 and the first
BLAS release was in 1979.

When you run `sessionInfo()` in `R`, it shows lines similar to:

```r
Matrix products: default
BLAS:   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/blas/libblas.so.3.10.0 
LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lapack/liblapack.so.3.10.0
```

Or similar to:

```r
Matrix products: default
BLAS:   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libblas.so.3 
LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.20.so;
LAPACK version 3.10.0
```

This information reveals that `R` is using the BLAS and LAPACK libraries for
linear algebra operations. BLAS and LAPACK are used internally when executing
functions such as `lm()`, `solve()` or `%*%`.

Armadillo also calls BLAS and LAPACK for linear algebra operations, and this
can be verified in its source code that contains the lines:

```cpp
#include "armadillo/def_blas.hpp"
#include "armadillo/def_lapack.hpp"
```

While it is possible to use BLAS or LAPACK directly in C++ code, Armadillo
provides efficient routines that largely simplify the syntax and the time
involved to write useable code, and it combines operations to reduce
intermediate steps and temporary objects when possible. Armadillo is not just
about speed, in some cases it is also about feasibility, as it allows to use the
available memory more efficiently and to run tasks that would be impossible with
the available memory if done in a naive way that involves creating temporary
objects and copies.

Just as an elemental example, without additional details, the following code
computes the dot product of two vectors using BLAS:

```cpp
// 2x2 matrix written as a long array
double a[4] = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};
    
// matrix to write the transposed result to
double at[4];

// dimensions
int r = 2, c = 2;

// transpose
cblas_dgeam(CblasRowMajor, CblasTrans, CblasTrans, rows, cols, 
  1.0, matrix, cols, 0.0, nullptr, cols, transposed_matrix, rows);
```

The same result can be obtained with `R`:

```r
A <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2)
At <- t(A)
```

The same result can be obtained with Armadillo:

```cpp
Mat<double> A = {{1.0, 2.0}, {3.0, 4.0}};
Mat<double> At = A.t();
```

Writing code directly in BLAS or LAPACK can be challenging, and it is very
challenging to beat BLAS or LAPACK performance. This is why `R` and Armadillo
use them for the internal computation and provide functions with a simplified
syntax for the end user. The interested readers can explore @zhang2024
to read about OpenBLAS, an even faster version of BLAS.

# R vectorization and loops

Some of `R`'s vectorized functions include `sum()`, `mean()`, `apply()` and its
variants, and `map()` and its variants in the `purrr` package
[@r2024; @wickham2019].

Instead of using the `mean()` function, the mean of a vector can be computed
with a loop in `R`:

```r
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

numerator <- 0
denominator <- length(x)

for (i in 1:denominator) {
  y <- y + x[i]
}

numerator / denominator
```

The previous loop is inefficient because it involves writing more code and it is
slower because it goes through each element one by one. In `R` or any other
interpreted language (e.g. Python), loops are slower than vectorized
operations. 

An example of efficient vectorization is the `pmax()` function to obtain the
element-wise maximum for vectors or matrices. The same can be done for two input
matrices with a loop in `R` that has the advantage of being explicit in terms of
the operations performed, but it is slower than the vectorized function:

```r
A <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2)
B <- matrix(c(4, 3, 2, 1), nrow = 2)

C <- matrix(0, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)

for (i in 1:2) {
  for (j in 1:2) {
    C[i, j] <- max(A[i, j], B[i, j])
  }
}
```

The problem with this loop is that it is particularly slow, for two
$1000\times 1000$ matrices filled random values created with `rnorm()`, it takes
takes 422 miliseconds to run, while the `pmax()` function takes 7 miliseconds.
In other words, the implemented loop is twenty times slower.

Loops should be used in computations where the one step depends on the previous
steps. One example of this is the Gram-Schmidt method to obtain an orthogonal
matrix from a square matrix $X$, in which case the $N^{th}$ vector depends on
the previous $1,2,\ldots,N-1$ vectors, and it consists of the following
algorithm adapted from @strang1988:

* Step 1: Construct a matrix $X$ of dimension $M \times N$ with the vectors to
    be orthonormalized as column vectors.
* Step 2: Construct a matrix $U$ of the same dimension as $X$ filled with zeroes
    to store the orthonormal basis later.
* Step 3: Replace the first column of $U$ with the vector
    $u_1 = x_1 / \| x_1 \|$, where $x_1$ is the first column of $X$ and
    $\| x_1 \|$ is the euclidean norm that is the square root of the sum of the
    squared $m$ coordinates $x_{1i}$ given by
    $\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^m x_{1i}^2} = \sqrt{x_1^t x_1}$.
* Step 4: For the remaining $M-1$ vectors $x_{j>1}$, calculate the projection of
    the vector $x_j$ onto the vector $u_j$ and subtracts it from $x_j$, this is
    $x_j = x_j - \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} (u_i^t x_j / u_i^t u_i) u_i$.
* Step 5: Normalize each $x_{j>1}$ to unit length as $x_j = x_j / \|x_j\|$ and
    replace it in the remaining columns of $U$.

In `R` this can be written as:

```r
X <- matrix(c(3,4,4,4), nrow = 2)
U <- matrix(0, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)

N <- ncol(X)

U[, 1] <- X[, 1] / sqrt(sum(X[, 1]^2))

for (j in 2:N) {
  v <- X[, j]
  for (i in 1:(j - 1)) {
    u <- U[, i]
    v <- v - (crossprod(u, v) / crossprod(u, u)) * u
  }
  U[, j] <- v / sqrt(sum(v^2))
}
```

This result is correct according to Wolfram Alpha, that returns the column
vectors $c_1 = (3/5,4/5)$ and $c_2 = (4/5,-3/5)$.

# Common pitfalls when transitioning from R to C++

## Syntax and defaults

Semicolons are mandatory in C++. C++ defaults to int for numbers, while `R`
defaults to double. In C++, you must declare the variable type.

The following `R` code treats $x$ as a double (e.g. a decimal number) unless
otherwise specified:

```r
# double
x <- 200
function(x) {
  x + 100
}

# integer
x <- 200L
function(x) {
  x + 100L # L = integer
}
```

C++ needs to declare the data type of the variable even if the number does not
have a decimal point:

```cpp
// integer
int x = 200;
double function(double y) {
  return y + 100;
}

// double
double x = 200.0; // x = 200 also works
double function(double y) {
  return y + 100.0; // y + 100 also works
}
```

In `R`, variable names can be recycled in any function without issues. In C++
the example, the function has an argument `y` instead of `x` because `x` was
previously declared in the global scope, and the code would not compile if the
function had an argument `x`.

## Lack of a terminal Shell

C++ lacks a dedicated terminal shell and cannot be used as a scientific
calculator like `R`. C++ code must be compiled and executed. An analogy for
this is that `R` is like ready-made Eggo waffles, while C++ is like making
waffles from scratch by mixing the ingredients.

## Data types

C++ requires explicit library inclusion for strings, vectors, matrices, lists,
and data frames, which are not natively available. `R` has built-in data
structures for these types. `cpp11` provides wrappers for these data structures,
which facilitate `R` and C++ integration. This is similar to `R`'s tibble, a
data structure not natively available in base `R` but that is provided by the
`tibble` package, and that enhances the data frame structure [@tibble].

In addition to `cpp11` vectors and matrices, Armadillo provides its own data
structures for linear algebra operations. Armadillo data structures are more
flexible and allow for a highly readable and concise syntax, this is why
`cpp11armadillo` exists, because `R` cannot directly use Armadillo data structures
unless there is a package that translates them to `R` data structures. This is
similar to `R`'s SQL integration, where the `rpostgres` package contains C++
code capable of translating a SQL query to a tibble [@rpostgres].

## Operations and indexing

C++ has useful operators that do not exist in `R` (e.g., ++, +=, and *=).
C++ is zero-indexed, whereas `R` is one-indexed.

The following `R` code sums the numbers in the sequence 5 7 4 4 2

```
x <- c(5, 7, 4, 4, 2)

for (i in 1:5) {
  x[i] <- x[i] + i
}
```

An equivalent C++ code is:

```cpp
int x[5] = {5, 7, 4, 4, 2};

for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
  x[i] = x[i] + (i + 1);
}
```

# Computational complexity

Computational complexity refers to the number of steps required to solve a
problem. It is expressed in terms of the size of the input data, $n$, and the
number of operations required to solve the problem.

The same algorithm implemented in different programming languages will retain
its computational complexity. Rewriting an `R` code in C++ may reduce the
chronological time to run a function, but the complexity will remain the same.
The only possibility to reduce the computational complexity is to write an
equivalent algorithm that implement different steps to do the same, which is
why reduced forms are important in the field of Econometrics and others.

C++ is faster for loops because the time (e.g., seconds) it takes for each
iteration of the loop is usually lower than in `R`, but for equivalent loops in
C++ and `R` the total number of operations is the same. One of the notations,
the big-O notation is expressed as $O(f(n))$, where $f(n)$ is a function that
describes the upper bound of the number of operations required to solve the
problem.

For the previous loop to compute the mean of a vector of $n$ coordinates (or
elements), the computational complexity is $O(n)$ because there are $n$ elements
to sum to create the numerator plus one division by the denominator given by the
number of elements, and this results in involves $n+1$ operations which is still
in the order of $O(n)$. Functions that require $n$, $n+10$ or $n-2$ operations
are still in the order of $O(n)$.

Making the loop to obtain the mean worse in terms of efficiency is useful to
clarify the computational complexity. Consider the following loop in `R`:

```r
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

numerator <- 0
denominator <- length(x)

for (i in 1:denominator) {
  y <- (y + x[i]) / denominator
}
```

This loop still has a complexity of $O(n)$, but it is less efficient because it
involves $n>1$ divisions, leading to $kn$ total operations with $k>1$. For the
big-O notation, $2n$, $3n$ or $200n + 100$ are also in the order of $O(n)$.

Regardless of the type of operation, big-O counts the number of operations. For
example, the geometric mean is computationally more expensive because
multiplication (and division) are slower than sums, but its complexity is still
$O(n)$.

Consider the following loop in C++:

```cpp
int sum = 0;
int n = 9;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  sum++;
}
```

The total number of operations is $3n+1$, because there is one operation to set
the initial value of `sum`, one to set the initial value of `n`, one to set the
initial value of `i`, $n$ verifications that $i<n$, $n$ increments of `i`, and
$n$ increases of `sum` by a value of one. The complexity is still in the order
of $O(n)$.

Other operations can be more expensive, such as matrix multiplication, which has
a complexity of $O(n^3)$ for two $n \times n$ matrices, and finding the inverse
of a matrix, which has a complexity of $O(n^3)$ for a $n \times n$ matrix.

# Reduced forms

Two function can reach the same result but with a different number of
operations, and therefore different complexity. Adapting from @emara2024,
here are two function written by Dante and Virgilio to compute $2^n$ using
recursion:

```cpp
int Dante(int n) {
  if (n == 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return (Dante(n-1) + Dante(n-1));
  }
}

int Virgilio(int n) {
  if (n == 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return (2 * Virgilio(n-1));
  }
}
```

The two functions are correct and equivalent, but the number of operations is
different. `Dante()` uses two recursive calls for each step, creating $2^n$
total calls, and therefore its complexity is $O(2^n)$. `Virgilio()` uses one
recursive call for each step, creating $n$ total calls, and therefore its
complexity is $O(n)$.

The second function is a reduced form of the first, and in practical terms it is
the same as simplifying $x^2 + 2x + 1$ to $(x+1)^2$ to reduce the number of
operations required to obtain the result. `R` and Armadillo internals make an
extensive use of reduced forms to optimize the code, and in general it is not
simple to write a reduced form in any language, especially for complex
operations such as regression models where the reductions can introduce a wide
range of issues (e.g., unintended divisions by zero in corner cases).

# Gauss-Jordan C++ implementation

Consider the following system of linear equations from @vargas2024:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
x_3
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
6.50 \\
7.50 \\
8.50
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

The system can be solved with row operations to obtain the inverse matrix:
\begin{equation*}
\overset{\text{row 2} - \text{row 1}}{\rightarrow} \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & | & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & | & -1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & | & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \newline
\overset{\text{row 3} - \text{row 2}}{\rightarrow} \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & | & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & | & -1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & | & 1 & -1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
-1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & -1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
6.50 \\
7.50 \\
8.50
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
6.50 \\
1.00 \\
7.50
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

The same can be done with a naive implementation of the Gauss-Jordan algorithm
that has complexity $O(n^3)$ [@strang1988]. It should serve as a starting point
to understand the syntax and the data structures.

```cpp
#include <cpp11.hpp>

using namespace cpp11;

[[cpp11::register]] doubles_matrix<> invert_matrix_(doubles_matrix<> a) {
  // Check dimensions
  int n = a.nrow(), m = a.ncol();
  if (n != m) {
    stop("X must be a square matrix");
  }

  // Copy the matrix
  writable::doubles_matrix<> acopy(n, n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      acopy(i, j) = a(i, j);
    }
  }

  // Create the identity matrix as a starting point for Gauss-Jordan
  writable::doubles_matrix<> ainv(n, n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      ainv(i, j) = (i == j) ? 1.0 : 0.0;
    }
  }

  // Overwrite Ainv by steps with the inverse of A
  // (find the echelon form of A)
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    double aij = acopy(i, i);

    // Divide the row by the diagonal element
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      acopy(i, j) /= aij;
      ainv(i, j) /= aij;
    }

    // Subtract the row from the other rows
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      if (i != j) {
        aij = acopy(j, i);
        for (int k = 0; k < m; k++) {
          acopy(j, k) -= acopy(i, k) * aij;
          ainv(j, k) -= ainv(i, k) * aij;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return ainv;
}

[[cpp11::register]] doubles_matrix<> multiply_inverse_(doubles_matrix<> a,
                                                       doubles_matrix<> b) {
  // Check dimensions
  int n1 = a.nrow(), m1 = a.ncol(), n2 = b.nrow(), m2 = b.ncol();
  if (n1 != m1) {
    stop("a must be a square matrix");
  }
  if (n1 != n2) {
    stop("b must have the same number of rows as a");
  }
  if (m2 != 1) {
    stop("b must be a column vector");
  }

  // Obtain the inverse
  doubles_matrix<> ainv = invert_matrix_(a);

  // Multiply ainv by b
  writable::doubles_matrix<> x(n1, 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
    x(i, 0) = 0.0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n1; j++) {
      x(i, 0) += ainv(i, j) * b(j, 0);
    }
  }

  return x;
}
```

The code above includes the `cpp11` library (`#include <cpp11.hpp>`) and loads
the corresponding namespace (`using namespace cpp11`) to simplify the notation
(e.g., typing `doubles_matrix<>` instead of `cpp11::doubles_matrix<>`). It
declares two functions, `invert_matrix_` reads a matrix from `R` in a direct
way (by making a copy) and returns its inverse and `multiply_inverse_` that
reads from `R` (`a` and `b`) and C++ (`ainv`), and solves a system of linear
equations.

These functions use `doubles_matrix<>` and `writable::doubles_matrix<>`. The
`writable::` prefix must be added every time the object will be modified later
or the code will not compile. The code was written in a modular way, organized
in two dedicated functions, and resulting object is assigned to a
`doubles_matrix<>` that goes from C++ to `R`. In the functions, `stop()`,
`nrow()` and `ncol()` are not a part of stock C++, these are provided by
`cpp11`.

# Gauss-Jordan Armadillo implementation

The previous Gauss-Jordan implementation can be largely simplified by using the
Armadillo library.

```cpp
#include <armadillo.hpp>
#include <cpp11.hpp>
#include <cpp11armadillo.hpp>

using namespace arma;
using namespace cpp11;

[[cpp11::register]]
doubles_matrix<> invert_matrix_(const doubles_matrix<>& a) {
  Mat<double> Acopy = as_Mat(a);
  Mat<double> Ainv = inv(Acopy);
  return as_doubles_matrix(Ainv);
}

[[cpp11::register]]
doubles_matrix<> multiply_inverse_(const doubles_matrix<>& a,
                                   const doubles_matrix<>& b) {
  Mat<double> Acopy = as_Mat(A);
  Mat<double> Bcopy = as_Mat(b);
  Mat<double> X = inv(Acopy) * Bcopy;
  return as_doubles_matrix(X);
}
```

The `inv()` function and the `*` operator verify the dimensions of the matrices.
This example shows that Armadillo largely simplifies the code. Its enhanced
speed is an extra feature to its readability and conciseness.

# Linear models in Armadillo

One possibility is to start by creating a minimal package with the provided
templates.

```r
install.packages("cpp11armadillo")
# or
# remotes::install_github("pachadotdev/cpp11armadillo")
cpp11armadillo::create_package("armadilloexample")
```

Given a design matrix $X$ and outcome vector $y$, one naive function (available
in the package template) to obtain the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator
$\hat{\beta} = (X^tX)^{-1}(X^tY)$ [@hansen2022] as a matrix (column vector) is:

```cpp
#include <armadillo.hpp>
#include <cpp11.hpp>
#include <cpp11armadillo.hpp>

using namespace arma;
using namespace cpp11;

[[cpp11::register]]
doubles_matrix<> ols_mat_(const doubles_matrix<>& y,
                          const doubles_matrix<>& x) {
  Mat<double> Y = as_Mat(y);
  Mat<double> X = as_Mat(x);

  // \beta = (X^tX)^{-1}X^tY
  Mat<double> b = inv(X.t() * X) * X.t() * Y;

  return as_doubles_matrix(b);
}
```

The previous code loads the corresponding namespaces (e.g., the
`using namespace arma`) in order to simplify the notation (e.g., using `Mat`
instead of `arma::Mat`), and then it declares the function `ols_mat()` that
takes inputs from `R`, does the computation on C++ side, and it can be called
from `R`. In this particular case, because the output has dimension $n\times 1$,
it is possible to use `doubles ols_mat_` and `as_doubles(beta)` to return an `R`
vector instead of a matrix.

Unlike the first Gauss-Jordan example, it uses the `inv()` function from
Armadillo instead of implementing the inverse. It also uses `X.t()` to
transpose and `*` to multiply matrices, which saves writing a loop to transpose
and three loops to multiply. Armadillo uses its own definition of the
multiplication operator, and when it is used with two matrices it does the same
as the `%*%` operator in `R`.

The use of `const` and `&` are specific to the C++ language and allow to pass
data from `R` to C++ by reference, that avoid copying the data, and therefore
save time and memory.

`as_Mat()` and `as_doubles_matrix()` are `cpp11armadillo` bridge functions to pass
data between `R` and the Armadillo library.

In order to use this function in `R`, it needs to be documented, and after
loading the package it is possible to compare with the `R` computation:

```r
devtools::document()
devtools::load_all()

x <- cpp11armadillo::mtcars_mat$x
x <- x[, c("wt", "cyl4", "cyl6", "cyl8")]
y <- cpp11armadillo::mtcars_mat$y

ols_mat(y, x)
```

This can be verified against the `R` code to verify that the solution is
$\hat{\beta} = (-3.21, 33.99, 29.74, 27.92)$:

```r
solve(t(x) %*% x) %*% t(x) %*% y
```

In `R`, the `lm()` function does not use a code similar to the previous
implementation. Instead, `R` uses the QR decomposition to solve the OLS problem,
which is more stable and efficient than the direct computation of the
inverse of $X^tX$.

A more robust OLS implementation is:

```cpp
#include <armadillo.hpp>
#include <cpp11.hpp>
#include <cpp11armadillo.hpp>

using namespace arma;
using namespace cpp11;

[[cpp11::register]] doubles_matrix<> ols_mat_qr_(const doubles_matrix<>& y,
                                                 const doubles_matrix<>& x) 
                                                 {
  Mat<double> Y = as_Mat(y);
  Mat<double> X = as_Mat(x);

  // (X'X)^(-1)
  Mat<double> Q, R;
  bool computable = qr_econ(Q, R, X.t() * X);

  if (!computable) {
    stop("QR decomposition failed");
  } else {
    // backsolve `R`
    Mat<double> b = solve(R, Q.t() * X.t() * Y);
    return as_doubles_matrix(b);
  }
}
```

The previous example, instead of directly inverting $X^tX$, creates empty
matrices $Q$ and $R$, and a boolean (e.g., logical) value for `qr_econ()`,
and then the QR function tries to decompose $X^tX$ into an orthogonal matrix
$Q$ and an upper triangular matrix $R$ such that $XtX = QR$. If the
composition is successful or not, the function returns "true" or "false"
respectively. The `solve()` arguments come from the fact that $R$ is upper
triangular, and backsolving from the last equation results in
$R\beta = QX^ty$.

## Logistic regression

Armadillo also provides additional data structures, such as field and cube,
which resemble a list of scalars, vectors or matrices and that are particularly
useful for loops.

Adapting from the OLS examples, it is possible to fit a logistic regression with
a loop that repeats calls to a function that returns the OLS coefficients. To do
this, the starting point is to transform the data by the logistic link function
[@mccullagh1989; @vargas2024]:
\begin{align*}
\mu &= \frac{y + 1/2}{2} \\
\eta &= \log\left(\frac{\mu}{1-\mu}\right) \\
z &= \eta + \frac{y - \mu}{\mu}
\end{align*}

From the transformed outcome $z$ and a design matrix $X$, we can implement a
Re-Weighted Least Squares (RWLS) algorithm to obtain the coefficients of the
logistic regression [@mccullagh1989]. The following code is a naive
implementation of the RWLS algorithm:

```cpp
#include <cpp11.hpp>
#include <cpp11armadillo.hpp>

using namespace arma;
using namespace cpp11;

Mat<double> rwls_mat_coef_(const Mat<double>& Y, const Mat<double>& X,
                          const Mat<double>& W) {
  Mat<double> Wd = diagmat(W);

  // \beta = (X^tWX)^{-1}X^tWY
  Mat<double> B = inv(X.t() * Wd * X) * X.t() * Wd * Y;
  return B;
}

[[cpp11::register]] doubles_matrix<> logistic_mat_coef_(
    const doubles_matrix<>& y, const doubles_matrix<>& x) {
  // v = original variables y and x
  field<Mat<double>> v = {as_Mat(y), as_Mat(x)};

  // nv = new variables mu, eta, and z
  field<Mat<double>> nv(3);
  nv(0) = (v(0) + 0.5) / 2;
  nv(1) = log(nv(0) / (1 - nv(0)));
  nv(2) = nv(1) + (v(0) - nv(0)) / nv(0);

  // s = scalars rss1, rss2, dif and tol
  // rss = residual sum of squares
  // dif = rss1 - rss2
  // tol = tolerance level for convergence
  // initialized with 1, 1, 1, and 0.05 as a starting point
  Col<double> s = {1, 1, 1, 0.05};

  // res = residuals without and with transformation
  field<Mat<double>> res(2);

  // b = regression coefficients
  Mat<double> b;

  while (abs(s(2)) > s(3)) {
    b = rwls_mat_coef_(nv(2), v(1), nv(0));
    res(0) = nv(2) - v(1) * b;
    nv(1) = nv(2) - res(0);
    nv(0) = exp(nv(1)) / (1 + exp(nv(1)));
    nv(2) = nv(1) + (v(0) - nv(0)) / nv(0);
    res(1) = v(0) - v(1) * b;
    s(1) = accu(res(1) % res(1));
    s(2) = s(1) - s(0);
    s(1) = s(0);
  }

  b = rwls_mat_coef_(nv(2), v(1), nv(0));
  return as_doubles_matrix(b);
}
```

# Conclusion

`cpp11armadillo` provides a simple and efficient way to integrate C++ code with
`R`, leveraging the `cpp11` package and the Armadillo library. It simplifies
the process of writing C++ code for `R` users, allowing them to focus on the
logic of the algorithm rather than the technical details of the integration. It
can help to solve performance bottlenecks in `R` code by using the efficient
linear algebra operations provided by Armadillo in cases where vectorization
is challenging.
